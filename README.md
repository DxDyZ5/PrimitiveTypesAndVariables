# Primitive types and variables in c#
We are going to define and explain primitive types. Besides, what is essential to know about them.

List of basic data types in C#:

1. Integer types: **sbyte, byte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, ulong;**
2. Real floating-point types:  **float, double;**
3. Real type with decimal presicion: **decimal**
4. Boolean type: **bool**
5. Character type: **char**
6. String: **string** 
7. Object type **object**

Note: Data types that are specified in the source code of the program are called `literals`.

Example of **literals:**

These data types are called primitive types, because they are injected at the lowest level of C#.

The following table show their range and their default values:

Now that we know what what are the primitive types in c#, we are going to explain what `variables` are.


A `variable` is container of information, storing data that can change during the span life of the program.

Since c# is type-safe, we need to declare the type and then the variable in order to assign a value. You must give a name to your variable in order to store a value.

Reccomandations to follow when you declare a variable name:
1. The variable name should describe what's the variable for.
2. A variable name should start with small letters.
     - Remember, c# is sensible to uppercase and lowercase letters. 
4. A variable name should be neither too long nor too short.

Examples of variables in c# and how they are located in the memory:

(Bad declarations of variables, though.)

In conclusion, pay attention to how declare your variables and how they can change in the program.
